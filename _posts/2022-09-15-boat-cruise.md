Apart from running a few errands close to home, we spent yesterday recovering. We still had a boat tour to redeem from our hop-on hop-off tickets, so we managed to stumble out the door in the afternoon to meander our way across town. It was an hour's walk to the pickup point which we broke up with our first time using a cool service, "too good to go". The app allows you to purchase grab bags from restaurants and groceries during specific windows (usually just before close), so they can get rid of surplus food. You don't know what you're going to get but it balances out by being ridiculously cheap. We bought two from a little pâtisserie on the way and wound up with a ton of treats like a wild pizza version of a croque monsieur, a quiche, a brownie, a cheese breadstick type thing, a mini loaf of bread, and more. A very healthy dinner, I know :)

On the way we happened upon a Keith Haring mural at a local hospital. Neat!

We stopped at a park to watch dogs play (dogs not pictured, whoops!) and to take inventory of our recent haul of pastries.

We timed our arrival to try and get on the sunset cruise only to find the world's largest queue, just barely missing it. But it ended up working out just fine - instead of being last on a full boat we were instead second on a completely empty boat and got the pick of the place! The time of day worked out in our favor as well - the city really lights up at night which was a great experience.

A bridge embellishment for yours truly (just kidding this is Notre-Dame)

The river is lined with all sorts of cool hangout spots:

On our way back, we ran into a bunch of people taking pictures in the street. We were confused until we turned the corner and … [click for video ~20mb](https://filedn.com/laDhrvFbMCaQeUUeqc8SpMB/2022-09-15/20220915_220130_sparkles.mp4){:target="_blank"}

Mr. JimJam said, "you're home already?!"

And the aftermath of Miss Vivian's shenanigans the next morning (nothing can stop them…)

Tomorrow is time to clean and pack, then we're off to London on Saturday morning!

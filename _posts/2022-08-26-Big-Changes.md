Lots of changes today: 
It was my last day of work, I sold my car, and am now essentially living out of a couple (gigantic) suitcases. To top it off, I woke up feeling quite under the weather. Thank goodness a quick covid test in the morning came back negative; I'm hopeful that it will pass after a good nights rest.

We are currently lounging in a hotel at the Denver Airport in prep for the first leg of travel to Newark tomorrow. We spend another night there (trying to break up travel for sake of our kitties), then boogie off to Paris Sunday evening. It's been a whirlwind of a few days; we are both really looking forward to things slowing down.

Sleep beckons me - a few images before I log off.

We made it to the airport!

edit: Big shoutout to Scoot for taking time away from his busy new job, helping us load his car to the brim with luggage, and whisking us away to the airport. You da best!
